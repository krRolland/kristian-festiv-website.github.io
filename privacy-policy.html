      <div class="extra-documents-small-header bulleted-text">A. CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT (&quot;CCPA&quot;)</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points">The CCPA requires us to provide our consumers who reside in California with the additional notice below.In the prior 12 months before the date of this Privacy Policy, we may have collected and disclosed for a business purpose the following categories of personal information:</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points extra-documents-extra-bullet-points"><br>• Identifiers, including account IDs, household ID, device identifiers, internet protocol addresses, browser cookies, and other unique online identifiers.<br>• Account Records, including name, address, email address, telephone number, and payment card number.<br>• Protected Classifications under California or Federal Law.<br>• Commercial Information, including products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.<br>• Electronic Network Activity, Internet or other electronic network activity information, including browsing history, search history, and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with an Internet website, application, service or advertisement.<br>• Geolocation data.<br>• Profiles and Inferences, inferences drawn from any personal information to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, predispositions, behavior, and attitudes.<br>• Audio/Visual Information, including audio, electronic, visual, or similar information.<br>• Professional/Employment Information.<br>‍</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points">But, we only disclose Account Records to contractors and service providers to help with our business operations and carry out work that we need to outsource (see Part III, Section B(1) above), and to business partners at your direction (for example, if you subscribe to a channel on device, you can authorize us to share your Festiv account information with the channel provider to avoid entering your information using the remote and to expedite the sign-up process).In the prior 12 months before the date of this Privacy Policy, we may have shared Identifiers, Protected Classifications, Commercial Information, Electronic Network Activity, Profiles and Inferences, and Professional/Employment Information with business partners to bring you ads that are more relevant and to measure and report on the effectiveness of ad campaigns. Under the CCPA, some of this data sharing may be broadly considered a “sale” of information even though these activities do not fit what most people would understand “sale” to mean. Except for this type of sharing, we do not sell your information.Part I of this Privacy Policy, “Information Collection”, describes the categories of sources from which we collect your personal information. Part II, Section A, “Information Usage, Use by or on Behalf of Festiv,” describes how we use your personal information. Part III, Section B, “Information Sharing, Festiv’s Sharing” sets forth the categories of service providers and business partners with whom we share your personal information.If you are a resident of California, you have the right to make the following requests, up to twice every 12 months:</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points extra-documents-extra-bullet-points"><br>• The right to request a copy of the personal information that we have collected about you in the prior 12 months.<br>• The right to request details about the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of sources, the business or commercial purposes for collecting information, and the categories of third parties with which we share information.<br>• The right to request deletion of the personal information that we have collected about you, subject to certain exemptions.<br>• The right to opt-out of sale of your personal information.<br>‍</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points">California consumers can submit a deletion and right-to-know request online by emailing us at info@festivmedia.com. To exercise the right to opt out, please visit our Do Not Sell page. Your rights are subject to certain exceptions under the CCPA.The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California consumers for exercising their rights under it and imposes requirements on any financial incentives offered to California consumers related to their personal information, unless the different prices, rates, or quality of goods or services are reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data.</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-small-header bulleted-text">B. CALIFORNIA&#x27;S SHINE-THE-LIGHT-LAW</div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text extra-documents-bullet-points">California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ.
