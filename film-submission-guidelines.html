      <div class="extra-documents-text">Any nonfiction film originating from outside the U.S. with a running time of 50 minutes or more, not including entirely scripted or improvised fictionalizations of actual events. If your documentary contains some dramatization of actual events, you may submit it for this classification, but we will ultimately decide which classification is best suited for your project, if accepted. In order to qualify as an International Documentary Feature Film, at least half of the submitted project&#x27;s financing must originate from outside the United States. Films that are world premieres are eligible for limited and wide-release theatrical acquisition consideration, and International Documentary Feature Films that have previously screened at five (5) or more other festivals anywhere in the world are eligible for acquisition consideration for release in any format and global screening to the entire community of Festiv Members. International Documentary Feature Films that have been, or will be, exhibited publicly at five (5) or more non-festival screenings, broadcast television or cable, or streamed on television, or released via any home video or other public distribution platform (Blu-ray, DVD, OTT Platform, VOD, etc.) prior to submission to Festiv are not eligible for acquisition consideration for limited or wide-release theatrical distribution but will be eligible for global screening on Festiv by the complete community of Festiv Members.<br>‍<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-super-small-header">Short Films:<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text">Any narrative or non-scripted work of fiction or nonfiction/documentary film of any genre originating from within the United States with a running time of less than 50 minutes, including credits. In order to qualify as a U.S. Short Film, at least half of the submitted project&#x27;s financing must originate from within the United States. U.S. Short Films have no premiere requirements or prior screening restrictions that would impact Platform eligibility. U.S. Short Films may have been screened at any number of Platforms or other public theatrical exhibitions anywhere in the world, broadcast or streamed on television or the Internet, and/or released via any home video or other public distribution platform and still remain eligible for Platform consideration.<br>‍<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-super-small-header">International Short Films:<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text">Any narrative or non-scripted work of fiction or nonfiction/documentary film of any genre originating from outside of the United States with a running time of less than 50 minutes, including credits. In order to qualify as an International Short Film, at least half of the submitted project&#x27;s financing must originate from outside of the United States. International Short Films have no premiere requirements or prior screening restrictions that would impact Platform eligibility. International Short Films may have been screened at any number of Platforms or other public theatrical exhibitions anywhere in the world, broadcast or streamed on television or the Internet, and/or released via any home video or other public distribution platform and still remain eligible for Platform consideration.<br>‍<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-super-small-header">Episodic Content:<br></div>
      <div class="extra-documents-text">Any narrative or non-scripted work of fiction or nonfiction/documentary series of any genre, originating from anywhere in the world, presented in or intended to be presented in a multi-episode format. Filmmakers may submit single or multiple episodes of a single project, as long as all episodes play continuously in one single video file for digital upload and do not exceed the 10GB file size limit. We accept both short-form and long-form content. Projects originating from within the United States are not eligible for the Platform if all of the submitted content has been made available in its entirety to the general public via any platform (broadcast television, Blu-ray, DVD, streaming, VOD, etc.) prior to submission to Festiv. . Projects originating from outside of the United States remain eligible if all of the submitted content has been released only within their country of origin or not released at all. You may submit episodes that have previously been screened on other Platforms, at other festivals, or broadcast and/or streamed via another platform, but you must also submit subsequent episodes that have not been screened by or released to the general public. For example, if your pilot episode has screened on another Platform or is available to screen at another festival, you may only submit it if you currently have additional episodes that have not been screened anywhere or otherwise made available to the public.<br></div>
